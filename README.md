# Blue Green Deployment in Kubernetes using Helm

This repository provides a Helm chart and deployment scripts to facilitate Blue Green deployments in Kubernetes using Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. Blue Green deployment is a popular technique that enables seamless, zero-downtime deployments by running two identical environments (blue and green) and gradually shifting traffic from one environment to another.

## Features:

- **Automated Deployment**: Deploy Blue Green deployments in Kubernetes with ease using the provided Helm chart and deployment scripts.
- **Zero Downtime**: Ensure smooth deployments with zero downtime by gradually shifting traffic from the blue environment to the green environment.
- **Easy Rollback**: Quickly rollback to the previous environment (blue) if any issues occur during the deployment process.
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Customize the deployment process and configuration options through Helm values to suit your specific requirements.
- **Scalability**: Seamlessly scale the blue and green environments based on traffic and resource utilization.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Monitor and collect metrics from both blue and green environments using popular monitoring solutions like Prometheus and Grafana.

## Getting Started:

To get started with Blue Green deployments using Helm, follow the documentation and installation guide available in the repository: [https://github.com/soumyadip007/Blue-Green-Deployment-in-K8S-using-Helm]
